# Deployment Guide
## System requirement
* Ansible 2.9

## Deployment Process
1. Make sure to use Unimelb VPN connection even though youâ€™re using campus network. Ansible may hangs if being run from unimelb network without proxy.
2. Clone the repo from https://github.com/Lysarthas/CCCa2 and go to `nectar` folder.
3. To deploy, here is three cases:
  3.1 create instances and setup remote instance and start the service. For the first case, run
  ```
  source ./openrc.sh
  ansible-playbook master.yaml --extra-var db_action=backup
  ```
  3.2 remote instance is all set and only setup/restart service (docker swarm, concul, couchdb, web app, etc). In this case, data from cluster will be backup to backup db in semi-realtime(couples of mins) in incremental manner. For the second case, run
  ```
  source ./openrc.sh
ansible-playbook remote.yaml --extra-var db_action=backup
  ```
  3.3 restart couchdb and store the data from `backupdb` to `cluster` when the cluster failed. This is a rare case. For the third case, run
  ```
  source ./openrc.sh
ansible-playbook remote.yaml --extra-var db_action=restore
  ```
